### What I learned

I learned about how DOM content can be manipulated using javascript. How to add different event listeners and react to them. I also explored how relevent items can be displayed or hide based on condition. The new thing that i learned while implementing this project was how to add kayboard navigation and how to handle keyboard events.


### Continued development

The javascript logics can be furthur improved.
